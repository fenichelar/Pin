## Style
- **Indent**: Tabs
- **Spacing**: See existing pages
- **One Line Conditionals**: Never
- **Comments**: Use Doxygen compatible comments [https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html)
- **General**: The goal is to be as clear as possible. Shorter code is not always better.

## Documentation
- Documentation is built using Doxygen
- Do not update documentation files! In other words, don't make pull requests for `gh-pages` branch which contains everything in the `/extra/documentation` directory, they will be ignored.
- Do add documentation to code in the form of Doxygen compatible comments.
