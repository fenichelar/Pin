This folder contains the Doxygen configuration files but does not contain the actual documentation.

To create the documentation, you must have Doxygen installed. Navigate to this location and run 'doxygen doxygen.config' without quotes.

The updated documentation will also be hosted here: https://pin.fenichelar.com/
